    <p>This API is used to get data about NBA teams and it's players.</p>
    <p>The options I used to get the team names was the /teams endpoint.
        I added a page=0 option to only get results of the first page, since I am only showing three teams.
    </p>

    <p>This API is useful if you want to create an application where users can see player or teams data, and track their performance.</p>
    <p>It can also be useful if you want to create a Basketball game. You can get two team names and its players for matches.</p>
